# [wip] vsts-mode
Emacs mode for Visual Studio Team Services

At the moment this is rather a collection of functions rather than a major-mode.

You have to add your credentials in your .authinfo.gpg file as such:

machine vsts login *vsts instance* password *password* project *project name* repo *repo name*

Main functions are
- vsts/show-query

- vsts/show-builds

- vsts/show-pullrequests
